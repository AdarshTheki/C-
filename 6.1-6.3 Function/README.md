## Functions:
Function is a piece of code that prefors a specific task.

The syntax of creating function in C++ language is given below:
```c++ 
function_name(data_type parameter...){
    //code to be executed
}
Example:-
void print(int num){
    cout<<num<<endl;
    return;
}
```
**There are two types of Functions in C++ programming:**

**1. Library Functions:** <br> 
The Functions which are declared in the C++ header files such as ceil(x), cos(x), exp(x), etc.

**2. User-defined Functions:** <br>
The Functions which are created by the C++ programmer, so that he/she can use it many times. It reduces complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.

Practies some Function code with example:-
*  Prime Number between two Numbers.  
*  Find Factorial n and n^r.
*  Find Fibenacci Sequence.
*  Sum of first n natural Numbers.
*  check Pythagorial Triplet.
*  Conversions:
    -   Binary to Decimal.
    -   Octal to decimal. 
    -   Hexadecimal to decimal
    -   Decimal to Binary.
    -   Decimal to Octal.
    -   Decimal to Hexadecimal.
*  Add two Binary Numbers.
