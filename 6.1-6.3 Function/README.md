## Functions:
Function is a piece of code that prefors a specific task.

The syntax of creating function in C++ language is given below:
``` 
    function_name(data_type parameter...){
        //code to be executed
    }
`Example:-`
    void print(int num){
        cout<<num<<endl;
        return;
    }
```
**There are two types of Functions in C++ programming:**

**1. Library Functions:** <br> 
The Functions which are declared in the C++ header files such as ceil(x), cos(x), exp(x), etc.

**2. User-defined Functions:** <br>
The Functions which are created by the C++ programmer, so that he/she can use it many times. It reduces complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.

Practies some Function code with example:-
1.  Prime Number between two Numbers.  
2.  Find Factorial n and r.
3.  Find Fibenacci Sequence.
4.  Sum of first n natural Numbers.
5.  check Pythagorial Triplet.
6.  Conversions:
    -   a. Binary to Decimal.
    -   b. Octal to decimal. 
    -   c. Hexadecimal to decimal
    -   d. Decimal to Binary.
    -   e. Decimal to Octal.
    -   f. Decimal to Hexadecimal.
7.  Add two Binary Numbers.
