## 2 - Introduction of loops:

The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use **For, while & do-while loops.** The C++ for loop is same as C/C#. We can initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

**For loop:**
```c++
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        // statements to execute in the loop body
    }
```
**While Loop:**
```c++
    while ('condition'){
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        'update_expr';
    }
```
**Do While loop:**
```c++
    do{
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        update_expression;
    }while(test_expression);
```
